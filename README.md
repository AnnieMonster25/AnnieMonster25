This project aims to explain autoencoders through pytorch code
The idea is to reconstruct the digits of the MNIST dataset using an Autoencoder architecture
Later additions to the project could be to include a generative effect.
The encoded space could be perturbed and decoded.
However since it is not a variational autoencoder, the reconstructed images might not have meaning.
